# ESDE-Docker
A docker image for making a gaming webtop that I can host privately


Looking around at emulator things, everything is compile-distributed on the AUR. Also, Debian might have low kernels.
Let's support an Arch host and an Arch image.
Compile dependencies and copy resulting binaries to folder as a ESDE portable installation.
Use a webtop from linuxserver.io
